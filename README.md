# APPLE'S WEBSITE WEBPAGE CLONE (2014)

The goal of this project is to make a clone of an old version of the Apple website webpage (2014).

> This project helps me master the concept of using images as a background and adding gradints to elements.
> I learned to sized and position the page using correct semantic HTML elements appropriately.
> Correctly setting up navigation bar.
> Played around with media queries to work a bit on the site responsiveness even though the origin isn't.
